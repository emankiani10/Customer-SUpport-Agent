# 📧 Customer Support Agent
This intelligent agent automatically manages your incoming emails by reading them from your Gmail inbox, generating AI-powered responses, and replying directly to the original sender.

## 🔍 How It Works
- The agent scans your Gmail inbox for new messages.
- It uses an AI model to understand the content of each email.
- Based on predefined rules, it crafts an appropriate response.
- It replies to the sender using your Gmail account.

## 🧠 Built-in Rule Logic
- 📱 **iPhone-related Inquiries**  
  If the email mentions an iPhone product, the agent responds positively, expressing interest in purchasing it.

- ❌ **All Other Topics**  
  For any other product or topic, the agent sends a polite message declining the offer.

## 🚀 Use Case
Ideal for individuals or businesses looking to automate email screening and response — especially useful for managing sales pitches, product promotions, or unsolicited offers.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Gmail account with API access enabled
- OpenAI API key or another AI model integration
- Email automation script (e.g., Python, n8n)
