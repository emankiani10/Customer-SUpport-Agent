# Customer-SUpport-Agent
This agent automatically reads incoming emails from your Gmail inbox, uses an AI model to generate a reply, and then sends that reply back to the original sender. 
It has a built-in rule:
•	If the email talks about an iPhone product, it sends a positive reply saying you’re interested in buying it.
•	Otherwise, it politely declines the offer.
This is useful for automating email screening and reply generation, especially for sales or product offers.
